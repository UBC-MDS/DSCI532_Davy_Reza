DSCI532 project repo for Crime Data Browser

Security is a key factor in choice of the city you want to live in, but when people talk about security, only a few of them rely on solid data to support their arguments. Thanks to Marshall project, we now have access to the crime data of 68 US cities from 1975 to 2015. In order to help people to understand this data base better, we are going to build an app to visualize the different aspects of the data. Our app will allow users to browse the crime data of a certain city and compare it with other cities and predict the crime rate in the future based on the historical data available to them.

Our app can be viewed at: https://davygriffin.shinyapps.io/crime_data_browser/.
